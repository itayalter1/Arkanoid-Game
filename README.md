# **Arkanoid Game**

A Java implementation of the classic Arkanoid game, developed using Object-Oriented Programming principles and designed with modularity and extensibility in mind. This project demonstrates skills in programming, software design patterns, and game development.

## **Features**

* Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built using Java Swing for an interactive and visually engaging experience.  
* Ball and Paddle Mechanics: Realistic ball movement and collision handling with the paddle, walls, and bricks.  
* Multiple Levels: Unique layouts for each level, increasing in difficulty as the game progresses.  
* Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score throughout the game.  
* Win/Lose Conditions: Game ends with a win if all bricks are destroyed, or a loss if the ball falls below the paddle.  
* Design Patterns Used: Includes the Singleton, Factory, and other OOP design patterns to ensure clean, reusable, and scalable code.

## **Future Improvements**

Here are some possible enhancements that could be added to the game:

* Add more challenging levels.  
* Introduce power-ups (e.g., larger paddle, slower ball, extra life).  
* Implement sound effects and background music.  
* Create a leaderboard to store high scores.  
* Support for multiplayer gameplay.
